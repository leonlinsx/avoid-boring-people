  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="subtext">Who I am, what I write about, and how to connect.</p>

  <!-- Bio -->
  <section class="bio">
    <p>
      I've worked in investing, investment banking, big tech, and startups — and
      I write to make sense of it all. I don’t only focus on those sectors
      though; I'll write about whatever sparks my curiosity!
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why I Write -->
  <section class="why">
    <h2>Why I Write</h2>
    <p>
      Writing helps me reflect on what I learn, clarify my thinking, and share
      ideas in a way that compounds. It’s how I’ve built knowledge,
      relationships, and opportunities, and how I expect to continue building
      them.
    </p>

  <!-- Beliefs -->
  <section class="beliefs">
    <h2>What I believe in</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare yourself only to your past self.</li>
      <li>Pursue excellence in the things that matter to you.</li>
      <li>Stay curious, and open to new ideas.</li>
      <li>You will fail. What matters more is what you do after that.</li>
      <li>Be clear about what you know and what you don’t.</li>
      <li>Be kind, but not slack.</li>
      <li>Be selective with who you spend time with.</li>
      <li>Do what you said you're going to do.</li>
      <li>
        Improve your process to make better decisions and get better outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The world is mostly noise and not signal, and you are easily fooled by
        randomness.
      </li>
      <li>Take more risks.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Consulting & Investing -->
  <section class="consulting">
    <h2>Consulting & Investing</h2>
    <p>I consult and angel invest selectively.</p>
    <p>
      I'm sector agnostic, but your business model has to make sense to me
      before I invest.
