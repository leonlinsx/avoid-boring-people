# Email Summary Digest Assessment & Recommendations

## 1. Prompting & Narrative
- **Current state**: Single DeepSeek prompt built for Twitter threads results in variable structure, occasional markdown/emoji leakage, and repeated points. 【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L41-L86】
- **Improvements shipped**:
  - Added reusable text sanitation helpers that enforce whitespace normalization and character limits in post-processing. 【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L21-L37】【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L95-L116】
  - Reframed the LLM instruction set around an email + social digest narrative, with explicit JSON schema, factuality guardrails, and de-duplication rules. 【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L63-L86】
- **Next opportunities**:
  - Extend the prompt with audience-specific tone controls (e.g., "operator", "founder") driven by metadata.
  - Capture confidence metadata from the LLM (e.g., flagged hallucination risk) and surface it to editors.

## 2. Ranking & Filtering
- **Current state**: Posts were selected purely by usage count and publish date, so short / off-topic posts frequently entered the queue. 【F:scripts/automation/state_manager.py†L23-L37】
- **Improvements shipped**:
  - Introduced configurable filtering by minimum word count, categories, and excluded tags, plus heuristic scoring based on freshness and tag preference. 【F:scripts/automation/ranking.py†L1-L88】
  - Updated the scheduler to apply these filters before selection and honor the heuristic `priority_score`. 【F:scripts/automation/auto_post.py†L34-L54】【F:scripts/automation/state_manager.py†L9-L34】
- **Next opportunities**:
  - Feed engagement signals (open rates, click-throughs) into `priority_score` to personalize ranking.
  - Cache and reuse scores across runs to avoid recomputation.

## 3. Coverage & Signal
- **Current state**: No guardrails to ensure posts met a minimum signal threshold (length, depth, freshness), risking low-value inclusions.
- **Improvements shipped**:
  - Filtering defaults now drop posts shorter than 180 words and boost longer, fresher, or tag-aligned pieces, providing better baseline coverage. 【F:scripts/automation/ranking.py†L45-L88】
- **Next opportunities**:
  - Track coverage across thematic pillars (e.g., finance vs. product) to avoid repetitive sends.
  - Incorporate a lightweight redundancy detector that suppresses posts already summarized in the last N digests.

## 4. Delivery
- **Observations**:
  - Delivery tooling is focused on social publishing; email digest export still manual. Consider adding an email templating stage that consumes the same summary objects used for social threads.
  - Add observability hooks (structured logs or GitHub summary) summarizing which posts were filtered out and why.

## 5. Additional Technical Improvements & Code Quality
- **Shipped**:
  - Normalized summary text sanitation, deduplication, and truncation to avoid runtime surprises when pushing to character-limited channels. 【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L21-L37】【F:scripts/automation/summarizers/llm_summarizer.py†L95-L116】
  - Added a dedicated ranking module with dataclass-backed configuration to keep heuristics isolated and testable. 【F:scripts/automation/ranking.py†L1-L88】
- **Roadmap**:
  - Write unit tests around `filter_posts` and `score_posts` to lock in behavior.
  - Move sensitive API configuration into typed settings objects shared across scripts.
